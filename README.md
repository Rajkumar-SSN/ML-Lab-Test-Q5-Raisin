# Raisin Dataset

## Overview
The Raisin Dataset contains images of two varieties of raisins, Kecimen and Besni, obtained using computer vision systems (CVS). A total of 900 raisin grains were used, with 450 pieces from each variety. The dataset consists of 7 morphological features extracted from the images, along with the class label indicating the raisin variety.

## Attribute Information
1. **Area**: Number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.
2. **Perimeter**: Measurement of the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.
3. **MajorAxisLength**: Length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
4. **MinorAxisLength**: Length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
5. **Eccentricity**: Measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.
6. **ConvexArea**: Number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.
7. **Extent**: Ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.
8. **Class**: The class label indicating the raisin variety (Kecimen or Besni).
